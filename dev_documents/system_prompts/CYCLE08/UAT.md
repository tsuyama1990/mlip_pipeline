# Cycle 08: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

## 1. Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Autopilot Run
**Priority**: Critical
**Goal**: Verify "Zero-Config" promise.
**Procedure**:
1.  Setup `config.yaml` for a mock system.
2.  Run `mlip-auto run`.
3.  Wait for completion.
**Success Criteria**:
*   Process finishes without crash.
*   `potentials/final.yace` exists.
*   Logs show successful transition through all phases.

### Scenario 2: Dashboard Inspection
**Priority**: High
**Goal**: Verify the user can see progress.
**Procedure**:
1.  Open `report.html` generated by the run.
2.  Check for graphs.
**Success Criteria**:
*   HTML loads in browser.
*   Plots for RMSE and $\gamma$ distribution are visible.

### Scenario 3: Crash Recovery
**Priority**: Medium
**Goal**: Verify the system can resume.
**Procedure**:
1.  Start run.
2.  Kill process (Ctrl+C) during Cycle 1.
3.  Restart run.
**Success Criteria**:
*   System detects `workflow_state.json`.
*   Logs say "Resuming from Cycle 1...".
*   It does *not* restart from Cycle 0.

```gherkin
Feature: Final Integration

  Scenario: End-to-End Active Learning
    GIVEN a fresh project configuration
    WHEN the Orchestrator runs
    THEN it should loop through Exploration, Selection, Oracle, Training, Validation
    UNTIL the potential passes validation OR max cycles is reached

  Scenario: Resume Functionality
    GIVEN an interrupted workflow
    WHEN the user runs the start command again
    THEN the system should load the last checkpoint
    AND continue from the exact phase where it left off
```
