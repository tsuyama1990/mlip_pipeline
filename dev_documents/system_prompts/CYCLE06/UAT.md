# Cycle 06 UAT: The Grand Challenge

## 1. Test Scenarios

| ID | Priority | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UAT-06-01** | High | **Physical Stability** | Verify that the Validator correctly rejects a potential that is numerically accurate (low RMSE) but physically unstable (imaginary phonons). |
| **UAT-06-02** | High | **MD-kMC Bridge** | Verify that a structure generated by MD (e.g., deposited island) can be successfully passed to EON for kMC simulation. |

## 2. Behavior Definitions

### UAT-06-01: Physical Stability

**GIVEN** a "Bad" potential that predicts a cubic crystal is stable when it should be tetragonal
**WHEN** the `Validator` runs the Phonon test
**THEN** it should detect imaginary frequencies at the Gamma point or zone boundaries
**AND** the validation result should be `passed=False`
**AND** the report should say "Dynamic Instability Detected"

### UAT-06-02: MD-kMC Bridge

**GIVEN** a final snapshot from an MD deposition simulation (`dump.lammps`)
**WHEN** the `Orchestrator` transitions to the "Ordering" phase
**THEN** the snapshot should be converted to EON's `reactant.con` format
**AND** EON should start searching for saddle points
**AND** the first accepted kMC step should lower the potential energy (finding a more stable configuration)
